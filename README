Welcome! This is the source code for Cross Your Heart, an Android app for solving crossword puzzles.

If you are interested in contributing, the code is mostly written in Java. The issue tracker has some ideas for initial projects. Key files include PuzzleViewModel, PuzzleFragment, and PuzzleListFragment.

The app makes heavy use of ViewModels and LiveData. For example, PuzzleViewModel has a MutableLiveData that tracks the currently selected cell, and acts as a source for the current clue text, which is stored in a MediatorLiveData object.

We also use a simple Room database to index puzzle files and store information that can't be stored in PUZ format (e.g., pen/pencil).
